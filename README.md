DFP API Data Extractor

Why do you want to use this? Because you want to get data from DFP into Excel but you don't want to write code.

DFP API Data Extractor is a code project developed in Java to help easier read-access of data using the DFP API. (“Data Extractor” in below).

In one sentence: it is a tool that retrieves data from DFP instructed by an XML configuration file.

What is this project’s purpose

The API has become the only solution to read from/write to DFP in many cases, especially when users of DFP are looking for an automated connection between their DFP accounts and the outside world, i.e. another software system they use.

Until now, writing ad hoc projects to achieve the above goal has been the common practice. Nothing is wrong with this approach except that it requires the users to have extensive knowledges on coding and that duplicates efforts in many ways.

DFP API Data Extractor is designed to address these problems. As its name indicates, Data Extractor pulls data from DFP through its API.
